The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it:

the 2 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+1),
the 3 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+2),
the 5 is (2+3),
and so on!

Example: the next number in the sequence above is 21+34 = 55

It is that simple!

Here is a longer list:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181, 6765, 10946, 17711, 28657, 46368, 75025, 121393, 196418, 317811, ...

Can you figure out the next few numbers?

Your assignment is to implement a function to print fibonacci sequence up to that number.

The function name: print_fib
The function argument: m, which is the upper bound for the printed fibonacci sequence.

For example, when I call the function:
print_fib(10)

The call should print
0
1
1
2
3
5
8

If I call the function like this:
print_fib(50)
The call should print
0
1
1
2
3
5
8
13
21
34

The function can be implemented using for loop or recursion, which we discussed in class.

You will receive extra credit if you implement both solutions.
